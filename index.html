						<p>My name is Mohamed Mohamud. I wanted to become a programmer for a long time.
							I used to be intimidated by coding that I never even tried to pursue it or attempt to give a try.
							I took A+ class in high school and ever since have been fixing cellphones, laptops, computers, printers
							and any malfuntioning electronics devices for family, friends and neighbors.
							I eventually opened a small electronics store with my younger uncle.
							It is a good feeling to be a business owner/entreprenuer.
							I enjoyed problem solving electronics for a living.
							I had no formal education in repair service and I wanted to learn more but behind the scene.
							I went to community college taking 1 or 2 classes over the next five years.
							The course work was easy but somehow I got occupied and jammed up by other tasks.
							After 5 years of on and off I eventually decided school is not for me, I learn better hands on. </p>
